Hi, I'am Simon - a multidisciplinary autodidactic nerd.
From 2004 to 2008 I did my training as a mechatronics technician (specializing in communication technology).
After that, I gained work experience in manufacturing and quality control.
In my private life I've spend a lot of time on web and embedded development.
Since 2013 I am at my current employer and have gained a lot of experience in the areas of SAP, data analysis, logistics, trade, labeling (Zebra) and many others.
Over the years I have learned various programming languages (Go, PHP, C, JS, R, â€¦) and with them a wide variety of programming concepts.
My favorite language at the moment is Golang, with which I have already implemented various professional and fun projects.
In addition to programming, I'm also very interested in photography (especially but not exclusively for aerial photography), electronics (Arduino, Raspberry, ...) and everything [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics). 
I am also a deputy fire brigade commander.
